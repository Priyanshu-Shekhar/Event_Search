# 📱Event Finder – Android Application
Event Finder is a modern Android application that enables users to search for nearby events, explore detailed event information, save favorites, and share events seamlessly. Built using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, the app follows Material Design 3 principles and provides a smooth, responsive user experience. It integrates a Node.js backend hosted on Google App Engine to fetch real-time event, artist, and venue data. The application supports location-based search, category filtering, persistent favorites, and deep integrations with external platforms such as Ticketmaster and Spotify. Asynchronous networking and lifecycle-aware UI components ensure reliability, performance, and scalability.
